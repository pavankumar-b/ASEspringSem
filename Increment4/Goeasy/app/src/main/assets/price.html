				<h3>Academics</h3>
				
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<h3>FRESHMEN ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h3>

</p>
<h3>FRESHMEN STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS</h3>
<p> There are three major categories of scholarships at UMKC - Automatic, Competitive and Academic Unit (program of study).
Automatic Scholarships - these are awarded to students based on information provided on the Admissions application and do not require an additional application. Freshman who apply to UMKC by January 15th and Transfer students who apply to UMKC by February 15th will be considered for these awards. Students who transfer in the spring semester should apply before November 15th. Freshmen are only eligible to receive one automatic scholarship.
Competitive Scholarships - these are awarded to current students based on completion of an annual scholarship application available online through the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. Incoming freshmen who apply to UMKC by January 15th and incoming transfer students who apply to UMKC by February 15th will be considered for competitive scholarships.
Academic Unit Scholarships - these are awarded to students by the school/program the student has been admitted to. Application procedures vary, check with your school to find out more.
We encourage you to look for scholarships from outside sources. You can find helpful links in the Additional Opportunities of each section below. </p>
